# SIH25102
Vidya Dropout is an early-warning system that identifies students at risk of failing before exam results arrive. By merging attendance, test scores, and fee data into a single dashboard, it highlights at-risk students with colour-coded alerts and sends automated notifications to mentors and guardians. Simple, transparent, and actionable, it empowers educators to intervene early and reduce drop-outs without extra costs or complex tools.
